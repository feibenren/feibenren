# 文档流
文档流也叫做常规流(css的叫法，normal flow)



Normal flow. In CSS 2.1, normal flow includes block formatting of block-level boxes, inline formatting of inline-level boxes, and relative positioning of block-level and inline-level boxes.




Floats, absolutely positioned elements, block containers (such as inline-blocks, table-cells, and table-captions) that are not block boxes, and block boxes with 'overflow' other than 'visible' (except when that value has been propagated to the viewport) establish new block formatting contexts for their contents.



块级格式化上下文中的“块级”两字并不是指BFC是由块级元素产生的，而是指块级元素会参加到BFC的布局中来。
